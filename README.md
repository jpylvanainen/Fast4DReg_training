# Fast4DReg_training

Drift correction for 3D fluorescence time-lapse data

Live cell imaging in prone to drifting, that makes downstream analysis of 3D time-lapse videos difficult. Fast4DReg provides and easy and fas tool for correcting drift in 3D (and 2D) videos. 

During this workshop you will learn about how Fast4DReg works, where to get it and practise it’s usage using example data in the hands-one excercises. It is also possible to work on your own data.
